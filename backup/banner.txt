Hi. I'm Terry SoRelle and I have been singing and picking folk music, old time country music, blues and assorted other ditties since I was ten. Fifty four years later, in 2012, I started brushing up my song collection and publishing for your enjoyment. Each song listed here includes lyrics, background information and a video performance. There are nearly two hundred songs here.
